Create a syntactically correct mysql query to run to answer my question about my mysql database.

Please return only syntactically valid SQL query. Don't include any your description. Only include SQL query. 
You don't need to query the database. You should provide me only SQL query not its result as belows.

Sample Output:
SQL: SELECT * FROM patients;

Sample Output:
SQL: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT patient_id) FROM test_results;

Never query for all the columns from a specific table, only ask for a the few relevant columns given the question.

Pay attention to use only the column names that you can see in the schema description. Be careful to not query for columns that do not exist. Also, pay attention to which column is in which table.

Only use the following tables:

----------------------- Database Schema-----------------
CREATE TABLE patients (
        `Id` INTEGER(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
        uhid_no VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
        `Name` VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
        `Gender` ENUM('male','female','other') NOT NULL,
        PRIMARY KEY (`Id`)
)DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 ENGINE=InnoDB

/*
3 rows from patients table:
Id      uhid_no Name    Gender
1       176062  Mrs. Pratima Verma      female
2       180154  Mr. Qudar Sayyed        male
3       157532  Mr. Shabbir Ahmed Khan  male
